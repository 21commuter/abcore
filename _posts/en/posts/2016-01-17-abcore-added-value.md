What's the reason to choose an Android Bitcoin Core full node instead a Linux/Windows/Macintosh one?

ABCore runs on Android Devices and you have these advantages:

- No need to keep active your PC/Server 24/7
- Low power consumption
- Easy replace external hard drive to store the Block-Chain
- You can install it on home devices that are already active 24/7 (like Minix Neo)
